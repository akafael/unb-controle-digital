# Z-Transform

The bilateral Z-Transform is defined as

$$X(z)= \sum^{\infty}_{k=i-\infty} x[k]z^{-k} $$

The unilateral Z-Transform is defined as

$$X(z)= \sum^{\infty}_{0} x[k]z^{-k} $$

## Review of Geometric Series

The sum of infinity term for geometric series is defined as

$$a+ar+ar^2+ar^3+ar^4+\cdots = \sum_{k=0}^\infty ar^k = \frac{a}{1-r}, \text{ for } |r|<1.$$
